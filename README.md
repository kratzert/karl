# Karl - Color-fading Chameleon lamp    

This is a very old project that I finally want to finish. Carl is a Chameleon shaped lamp into which I installed 60 NeoPixel RGB LEDs. The LEDs are controlled by an Arduino Micro and the color of each LED can be set individually. For the moment, the code does nothing else than slowly fading between random colors. Before getting more fancy with the LED controll (e.g. adapting the color fading to sound, add switches to controll the fading velocity, etc.), I still need to find a good way to mount Karl on the wall.
